For input vector A, returns a vector B with outliers (at the significance level alpha) removed. Also, optional output argument idx returns the indices in A of outlier values. Optional output argument outliers returns the outlying values in A. 
  
ALPHA is the significance level for determination of outliers. If not provided, alpha defaults to 0.05. 
   
REP is an optional argument that forces the replacement of removed elements with NaNs to preserve the length of a. (Thanks for the suggestion, Urs.) 
  
This is an iterative implementation of the Grubbs Test that tests one value at a time. In any given iteration, the tested value is either the highest value, or the lowest, and is the value that is furthest from the sample mean. Infinite elements are discarded if rep is 0, or replaced with NaNs if rep is 1 (thanks again, Urs). 
   
Appropriate application of the test requires that data can be reasonably approximated by a normal distribution. For reference, see:

A good online discussion of the test is also given in NIST's Engineering Statistics Handbook:

ex: 
[B,idx,outliers] = deleteoutliers([1.1 1.3 0.9 1.2 -6.4 1.2 0.94 4.2 1.3 1.0 6.8 1.3 1.2], 0.05) 
returns: 
B = 1.1000 1.3000 0.9000 1.2000 1.2000 0.9400 1.3000 1.0000 1.3000 1.2000 
idx = 5 8 11 
outliers = -6.4000 4.2000 6.8000 
  
ex: 
B = deleteoutliers([1.1 1.3 0.9 1.2 -6.4 1.2 0.94 4.2 1.3 1.0 6.8 1.3 1.2 Inf 1.2 -Inf 1.1], 0.05, 1) 
returns: 
B = 1.1000 1.3000 0.9000 1.2000 NaN 1.2000 0.9400 NaN 1.3000 1.0000 NaN 1.3000 1.2000 NaN 1.2000 NaN 1.1000
